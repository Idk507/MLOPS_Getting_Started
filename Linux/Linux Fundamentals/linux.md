## What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system (OS) that powers everything from personal computers to servers, supercomputers, and even smartphones (like Android). Unlike proprietary systems like Windows or macOS, Linux is freely available, customizable, and maintained by a global community of developers.

* Open-Source: The source code is publicly accessible, meaning anyone can modify, distribute, or contribute to it.
Key Features:
* Multitasking and Multiuser: Supports multiple users and tasks running simultaneously.
* Stability: Known for being reliable and rarely crashing.
* Security: Strong permission systems and fewer vulnerabilities due to open-source scrutiny.
* Flexibility: Runs on diverse hardware, from Raspberry Pi to massive servers.
* Linux was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991 as a free alternative to Unix, a powerful but expensive OS. Today, Linux is the backbone of the internet, cloud computing, and many embedded systems.
