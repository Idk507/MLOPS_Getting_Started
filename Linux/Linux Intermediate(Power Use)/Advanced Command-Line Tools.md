### 1. Advanced Command-Line Tools

These tools are powerful for processing text, manipulating data, and chaining commands. Theyâ€™re essential for scripting and automation.

#### `xargs`
- **Purpose**: Reads items from standard input (e.g., a list of files) and passes them as arguments to another command.
- **Use Case**: Execute commands on multiple files or inputs dynamically.
- **How it Works**: Takes input (often piped from another command) and builds commands to execute.
- **Examples**:
  ```bash
  # Delete all .txt files found by find
  find . -name "*.txt" | xargs rm -v
  # Output: removed 'file1.txt', removed 'file2.txt'
  ```
  ```bash
  # Convert a list of files into arguments for ls
  echo "file1.txt file2.txt" | xargs ls -l
  ```
- **Options**:
  - `-n1`: Process one item at a time.
  - `-I {}`: Replace `{}` with input (e.g., `find . -name "*.txt" | xargs -I {} mv {} {}.bak`).
- **Tip**: Use with `find` or `grep` to handle lists of files or search results.

#### `cut`
- **Purpose**: Extracts specific sections (columns or fields) from lines of text.
- **Use Case**: Parse delimited files (e.g., CSV) or extract specific columns.
- **Examples**:
  ```bash
  # Extract the first column from a CSV file (delimiter: comma)
  cut -d',' -f1 data.csv
  ```
  ```bash
  # Extract characters 1-5 from each line
  cut -c1-5 file.txt
  ```
- **Options**:
  - `-d`: Specify delimiter (e.g., `,` or `:`).
  - `-f`: Select fields (e.g., `-f1,3` for fields 1 and 3).
  - `-c`: Select characters by position.
- **Tip**: Useful for quick data extraction from structured files like `/etc/passwd`.

#### `awk`
- **Purpose**: A powerful text-processing language for pattern matching and data manipulation.
- **Use Case**: Extract, transform, or summarize data from structured text.
- **How it Works**: Processes input line by line, splitting lines into fields (columns).
- **Examples**:
  ```bash
  # Print the first and third columns of a space-delimited file
  awk '{print $1, $3}' file.txt
  ```
  ```bash
  # Sum the second column of a file
  awk '{sum += $2} END {print sum}' data.txt
  ```
  ```bash
  # Print lines where the first column matches "user"
  awk '$1 == "user" {print}' file.txt
  ```
- **Key Concepts**:
  - `$1`, `$2`, etc.: Refer to fields (columns) in each line.
  - `BEGIN` and `END` blocks: Run code before/after processing.
  - Patterns: Filter lines based on conditions (e.g., `$1 == "user"`).
- **Tip**: Ideal for parsing logs or tabular data; more powerful than `cut`.

#### `sed`
- **Purpose**: Stream editor for transforming text (e.g., search and replace, delete lines).
- **Use Case**: Edit files or streams programmatically.
- **Examples**:
  ```bash
  # Replace "foo" with "bar" in a file
  sed 's/foo/bar/g' file.txt
  ```
  ```bash
  # Delete lines containing "error"
  sed '/error/d' file.txt
  ```
  ```bash
  # Edit a file in-place
  sed -i 's/old/new/g' file.txt
  ```
- **Options**:
  - `s/pattern/replacement/`: Substitute pattern with replacement.
  - `-i`: Edit file in-place.
  - `/pattern/d`: Delete lines matching pattern.
- **Tip**: Use with pipes or for quick edits to configuration files.

#### `tee`
- **Purpose**: Reads from standard input and writes to both a file and standard output.
- **Use Case**: Save output to a file while displaying it in the terminal.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  # Save ls output to a file and display it
  ls -l | tee output.txt
  ```
  ```bash
  # Append to a file instead of overwriting
  ls -l | tee -a output.txt
  ```
- **Tip**: Useful for logging command output while monitoring it.

#### `sort`
- **Purpose**: Sorts lines of text.
- **Use Case**: Organize data alphabetically or numerically.
- **Examples**:
  ```bash
  # Sort a file alphabetically
  sort file.txt
  ```
  ```bash
  # Sort numerically
  sort -n numbers.txt
  ```
  ```bash
  # Sort in reverse order
  sort -r file.txt
  ```
- **Options**:
  - `-n`: Numeric sort.
  - `-r`: Reverse order.
  - `-k`: Sort by specific field (e.g., `sort -k2` for second column).
- **Tip**: Combine with `uniq` to remove duplicates.

#### `uniq`
- **Purpose**: Filters duplicate lines from sorted input.
- **Use Case**: Remove or count repeated lines.
- **Examples**:
  ```bash
  # Remove duplicates (must be sorted)
  sort file.txt | uniq
  ```
  ```bash
  # Count occurrences of each line
  sort file.txt | uniq -c
  ```
- **Options**:
  - `-c`: Count occurrences.
  - `-d`: Show only duplicate lines.
- **Tip**: Always use `sort` before `uniq` for correct results.

#### `diff`
- **Purpose**: Compares two files and shows differences.
- **Use Case**: Identify changes between versions of a file.
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  # Compare two files
  diff file1.txt file2.txt
  # Output: Lines prefixed with < (file1) or > (file2)
  ```
- **Options**:
  - `-u`: Unified format (easier to read).
  - `-r`: Compare directories recursively.
- **Tip**: Use with `patch` to apply changes.

#### `wc` (Word Count)
- **Purpose**: Counts lines, words, or characters in a file or input.
- **Examples**:
  ```bash
  # Count lines, words, and characters
  wc file.txt
  # Output: 10 50 300 file.txt (lines, words, characters)
  ```
  ```bash
  # Count only lines
  wc -l file.txt
  ```
- **Options**:
  - `-l`: Lines.
  - `-w`: Words.
  - `-c`: Characters.
- **Tip**: Useful for analyzing log files or script outputs.
